 What was that video game? The guy got in trouble because he made a video of him torturing some... Red Dead too. He punched a woman in the face that was protesting for women's rights to vote. And he got in trouble! But it's a thing you can do in the game. Right! There's one where a guy rides her to a swamp and throws her to an alligator which then eats her. That is so crazy that you can do that.
